A repositroy to host firmware/software related to the DIY Geiger-Mueller
counter units.

http://www.tokyohackerspace.org/en/event/DIY-GM-workshop-08_22

To be able to update/change the firmware of your DIY GM counter, you'll need:
a) a toolchain to build (compile/link) the source for the Arduino
b) a tool to upload the binary to the flash of the Arduino
c) way to access the source code and related libraries

One relatively simple way is to download the appropriate "Arduino IDE" for your
OS of choice from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software since this provides both
a) and b) above.

If you are not into development just get a stable snapshot from
https://github.com/thinrope/NetRad-THS, otherwise use your favorte git tool to
improve the source and send pull requests.


THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS< PLEASE BEAR WITH ME!
Feel free to submit issues, or contact the developers directly.
